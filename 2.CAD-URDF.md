# Creating URDFs From CAD — SolidWorks, Fusion 360, and Onshape

Designing a URDF manually is possible, but most production robots start from CAD models. This document presents workflows to convert CAD assemblies into URDF packages suitable for Isaac Sim, ROS 2, and Gazebo.

A. SolidWorks → URDF

SolidWorks has a mature URDF export pipeline via community and ROS Industrial add-ins.

Method 1: SolidWorks ROS URDF Exporter (recommended)

This add-in automatically detects mates and converts them into URDF joints. Key features:

- Exports links, joints, and inertial values
- Preserves colors and materials for visual meshes
- Auto-calculates inertia where CAD material properties are present
- Exports STL/DAE meshes and a URDF package

Typical steps

1. Install the ROS URDF Exporter add-in (SW2URDF / ROS Industrial plugin).
2. Open the assembly and assign coordinate frames to parts (important for joint axes).
3. Define mates that correspond to mechanical joints (revolute, slider, etc.).
4. Export the URDF package.

Typical output layout

my_robot/
├─ urdf/my_robot.urdf
├─ meshes/base_link.STL
├─ meshes/link_1.STL
└─ materials/

Notes for Isaac Sim

- SolidWorks meshes are often high-density; decimate visual meshes and replace CAD collision geometry with simple primitives (boxes, cylinders) for simulation.
- Validate inertia exported by the plugin against CAD-reported values.

B. Fusion 360 → URDF

Fusion 360 supports URDF export through an add-in. It can export meshes, joint definitions, and inertia information when physical materials are assigned.

Steps

1. Install the Fusion 360 URDF Exporter add-in.
2. Model the robot as a fully constrained assembly and assign physical materials to components.
3. Define joint origins, types (revolute/prismatic), and group parts into links.
4. Export the URDF package (meshes and URDF file).

Notes

- Ensure each component has a physical material and mass defined; otherwise Fusion cannot compute inertia.
- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., `base_link`, `arm_link`, `joint_1`).

C. Onshape → Recommended workflow

Onshape (cloud CAD) offers a streamlined, browser-based URDF export via community plugins. It is often the easiest route for beginners and small teams.

Advantages

- No local installs; runs in the browser
- Exporter reliably detects mates and joint parameters
- Produces clean, centered meshes with computed inertia

Steps

1. Install the Onshape-to-URDF plugin (community-developed).
2. Model the robot as an assembly and use mates to define joints.
3. Use the plugin to configure joint origins, scaling, naming, and mesh format.
4. Export the URDF package.

Typical output layout

my_robot_description/
├─ urdf/my_robot.urdf
└─ meshes/
├─ base_link.dae
├─ link_1.dae
└─ link_2.dae

Why choose Onshape for the tutorial repository

- Recommended for beginners due to ease of use
- Clean joint conversions and mesh exports
- Platform independent (Windows, Mac, Linux)

D. Cleanup After Exporting From CAD (required for simulation)

CAD exports typically require post-processing before simulation. Perform the following steps for each exported URDF package:

1. Reduce mesh complexity

- Visual meshes can remain detailed; collision meshes should be simplified aggressively.
- Use Blender or MeshLab (Decimate modifier) to reduce polygon count; target 30–70% of the original for visual meshes and much lower for collision.

2. Replace or simplify collision geometry

- Prefer primitive shapes (box, cylinder, sphere) for collision where possible.
- If complex collision is required, use a low-poly convex mesh.

3. Fix coordinate system and orientations

- Confirm URDF coordinate conventions: X forward, Y left, Z up.
- Many CAD tools use different defaults; adjust link and joint origins when exporting.

4. Verify joint axes and frames

- Inspect joint axes in a URDF viewer (RViz or urdf_viewer). Correct any axes that are rotated or swapped.

5. Validate the URDF

- Run `check_urdf my_robot.urdf` to detect common errors.
- Visualize the URDF in RViz or your simulator and verify CoM locations and joint behavior.

6. Verify in Isaac Sim

- Import the URDF with Isaac Sim's URDF Importer and inspect the preview tree for articulation structure and joint limits.

E. Best Practices for CAD → URDF

- Use explicit, consistent names: `base_link`, `arm_link_1`, `wheel_left`.
- Keep visual and collision meshes separate.
- Provide accurate mass and inertia from CAD whenever possible.
- Use continuous joints for wheels and properly model joint limits for actuated joints.
- Avoid extreme scaling; values that are orders of magnitude different from real units cause instability.

Importing URDF into Isaac Sim (parameters and checks)

URDF is the canonical description format for robot structure. When importing into Isaac Sim:

- Ensure every link has an `<inertial>` block with realistic `mass` and `inertia` values.
- Confirm that joint `<axis>` values are defined relative to the joint frame and oriented correctly.
- Use simplified collision geometry for simulation performance and stability.
- If you maintain a single URDF for both Gazebo and Isaac Sim, keep Gazebo-specific plugin tags but avoid relying on them for Isaac-specific behavior.

Validation checklist before simulation

- [ ] All links include `<inertial>` with realistic values.
- [ ] Inertia tensors are symmetric and positive definite.
- [ ] Joint axes are defined and oriented consistently.
- [ ] Collision geometry is simplified.
- [ ] Meshes are scaled appropriately and match mass/inertia assumptions.

Tools and commands

Use the following tools during the CAD→URDF workflow:

- `check_urdf path/to/my_robot.urdf` — basic URDF validation
- RViz or `urdf_viewer` — visualize frames, CoM, and joint axes
- Blender / MeshLab — mesh decimation and cleanup

If desired, I can add a short script to compute composite inertia from primitives, or provide a sample `package.xml` and `CMakeLists.txt` for a URDF package. Let me know which next step you prefer.
